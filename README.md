2. Presentation Delivery
Whether you are presenting onsite or remotely, here are the things we look for when you are presenting.

Please note, if you are presenting remotely, you will need to have your webcam on while your group is presenting.

Were the Presenters audible?
Did the Presenters speak clearly and at an understandable pace?
Were there minimal filler words, like “Uhm”, “uhh”, “like”?
Were the Presenters well-positioned on stage/in the camera’s view?
Did the Presenters’ postures demonstrate confidence?
Were the Presenters dressed professionally?
Did the presentation utilize the time allotted? (it was not too long, or too short)
Were the Presenters energetic?
Did the Presenters engage the audience with a question?
 
3. Live Demo
For teams who are working on web apps, a live demo means that the presentation must load the deployed website during the presentation and demonstrate at least one of the key features.

For teams who are not working on a web application, please prepare a video of the application being used. This includes the Maze project.

Not all parts of the application need to be demonstrated. As an example, if a project required uploading a file and waiting for 30m to process the data, it is enough to show that the file can be uploaded and that there is output generated from a previous run that is representative of the eventual output.

Scoring will be as follows: 5/5 points for a functional, engaging demo 3/5 points for a simple demo 0/5 points for a demo that meets unworkable errors or failures
4. Answering audience questions
This is a great list of guidelines for how to answer questions during a presentation: Witt.com

If the Presenters receive questions from the audience, they are answered in a satisfactory way, or there is an offer to followup with an answer.
